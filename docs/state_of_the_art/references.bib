  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a new automated method to detect offsides from football match videos. The advantage of our method is that it can strictly follow the official offside rules in which the dynamics of play actions are spatio-temporally investigated. Furthermore, to overcome the difficult task of tracking the two-dimensional locations of the players and the ball, we utilized geometric characteristics on the perspective projection coupled with a Kalman filter to estimate information necessary for offside detection. Based on these methods, our prototype system can recognize whether an attacking player who crossed the offside line receives a pass from their teammate or not. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first method that can automatically determine offsides from video. Furthermore, this method is designed to enable online processing in the future.},

  abstract = {The outcome of football matches is heavily dependent on referee decisions regarding violations of the offside rule. Football players should decide the outcome of the game rather than the referees. Instead of technology discrediting the ability of referees it should be adopted into the game to increase the accuracy of the offside decision. A system has been proposed that uses player tracking technology to quantify players’ positions and runs an algorithm to determine which players are offside. The likelihood of algorithm error is dependent on the accuracy of player tracking technology. It was found that algorithm accuracy is improved by increasing the sampling rate and precision of player tracking technologies. The most suitable technology form for use in the proposed system is camera based player tracking. No device is required to be worn by players and body segment positions can be determined to ensure the offside law is completely adhered to. Before this proposed system could fully function a series of improvements must be made to the proof of concept model.}
